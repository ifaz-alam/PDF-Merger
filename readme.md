# PDF Merger with Bookmarks

This is a small Python script that can be used to merge multiple PDF files with bookmarks. The script uses the PyPDF2 and natsort library to merge the PDF files in order and add bookmarks to the merged file.

1. Place the PDF files that you want to merge into a directory called `Files`.
2. Run the script using `python main.py` in your command prompt or terminal.
3. The merged PDF file with bookmarks will be created in the same directory as the script, with the filename of your choice.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyPDF2 library
